        <p>If you ask me if there's something I can't live without, but I despise the most, that would be my alarm clock. I'm sorry, Alarm, keep your ears shut, but I can't resist this. Now it's time you get an earful!</p>
        <p>Now, I have really tiring days. And of course, I meet a lot of people throughout the day who make me feel crap. Naturally, my ambitions soar high as I set the alarm for the next day. But as I said, I have long dreary work days and I need my rest! This stupid thing doesn't even bother! It keeps crowing, and doesn't shut up, till I actually wake up and turn it off, I mean, how cruel is that?</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">(Alarm muffled) But you don't look tired at night! What's with all the scrolling and gossiping? </p>
        <p>Umm... I need my privacy! I need some me-time! You expect me to behave like a robot or what?</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">I don't think me-time is supposed to go till the next morning, is it? </p>
        <p>Another word and I'm gonna bonk you on the head! Just shut up and go to sleep! Why are you even awake at this time - you're supposed to scream your throat off in the morning, right?</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Which makes me understand you aren't in your senses. Didn't I just tell you it's morning? </p>
        <p>Oh damn, it is. Maybe I'll resume my cursing after work today, gotta go!</p>
