        <p>Dude, life's gonna be so exciting if we meet all these apps in person, right? Like think about it, we spend so much time on different apps, and those apps actually start defining our personality and changing it! Isn't that what people do? Like the guys you hang out with! Everyone's gonna have something which keeps them together, and if someone feels left out, they adapt and inherit that characteristic. Feels a bit philosophical?</p>
        <p>I couldn't help but imagine what all these apps are gonna be like once they're real, living human beings.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">(Netflix snoring) Arff! Quiet please! I need a break! A long well-deserved break! (snoring continues)</p>
        <p>From what?? Binge-watching all night? What the heck bruhh? </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">(Instagram dashes off after a click of the camera) I'm gonna be the first to post the colour of my toothpaste! Yay!! I wonder how many likes I'm gonna get today! And if X is not gonna give me a like, I'm gonna ignore him for the rest of my life! Hmph!</p>
        <p>Brother, what's with the colour of toothpaste?! Omg, where has this world gone to, you can't do a single thing without showing others what you did? Great job, fellas! This world is becoming a mental asylum!</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">(Twitter with a notepad) What did you say? Let's see how your comment is gonna go crazy among the public! Ha ha!</p>
        <p>Wow, I've had enough of this! People won't let me live in peace over here, bruhh!</p>
