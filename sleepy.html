        <p>Life as a baby. So simple, so sweet. I blink, and there I was sitting in school, with a bunch of boring subjects. Huh? I blink again, and then find myself struggling in the rat race to get into a prestigious college for the most sought-after degree : B.Tech in Computer Science. And now here I am at NIT Calicut, racking my brain to decipher the language in which the profs teach. How did my life change so drastically?</p>
        <p>To be very frank, being an adult is damn hard. I regret everything I dreamed of as a child - lots of freedom, money, travel, luxury - it was all a big, horrid lie. Throughout the process of growing up did I realize that being an adult had more responsibilities than enjoyment.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">I told you so! You and your brother never realize the pain of what your father and I have been undergoing all these years. And you don't even care to behave yourselves. What have I told you about...</p>
        <p>Oh, cmon, Mom, I know!!! Now, where was I? </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Your so-called responsibilities? You're not even an adult yet, what the heck are you even claiming to be your responsibilities? Swallowing and scrolling?</p>
        <p>I'd better go somewhere else, or this won't end right. Now, as a child, I just had to go to school and study some crap. College is sooo baad! My parents were like "Don't worry, dear! After school, you can enjoy to your heart's content in college! It won't be stressful at all!". Indeed that was the case! College is like 1000 times more stressful. You have a ton of syllabus which the prof dashes through on the last day of class, quizzes, assignments, horrible labs, and on top of it all, a stupid class where no one talks to no one. Wow, this was never what I expected of college! Is this the paradise I was dreaming of all along?</p>
        <p>And back to responsibilities, you really really realise the value of money. And parents. And true friends. And the food you used to deny vehemently at home. I can't imagine my life in 2 years - I have to go for a job everyday, work till God knows what time, no holidays, manage my money, take care of everyone, phew! All I can think of is sleeping!</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">You missed scrolling Instagram, dear! We'd become billionaires if that was your profession!</p>
        <p>Never mind, I'll grieve over this matter later! Till then, adieu!</p>
